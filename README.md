# Who is this made by?
I did not make this, the YouTuber Kiddy Kene did. Please show them support [here](https://www.youtube.com/@KiddyKene), they put a lot of hard work into these awesome worlds and texture packs.

# Why did I back this up when it still exists?
I like esoteric programming languages, which is a topic that due to its retro vibes has a tendency for links and content to disappear off the internet for good, or for the only way to get them being an obscure place that may disappear soon from lack of maintenance.

All of this has taught me that the saying of "it'll be here tomorrow" does not always apply to software and the internet. While Kiddy Kene is still active, a lot of YouTubers are leaving left and right, and there's a good chance
their discord servers will be shut down with it.

With all of that in mind, this is a backup of Kiddy Kene's Minecraft creations. This is not intended to steal or infringe, but merely to preserve if that ever becomes necessary. 
Because we really wouldn't want months and months of his work to disappear.
