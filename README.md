# Who is this made by?
I did not make this, the YouTuber Kiddy Kene did. Please show them support [here](https://www.youtube.com/@KiddyKene), they put a lot of hard work into these awesome worlds and texture packs.

# Why did I back this up when it still exists?
I like esoteric programming languages, which is a topic that due to its retro vibes has a tendency for links and content to disappear off the internet for good, or for the only way to get them being an obscure place that may disappear soon from lack of maintenance.

All of this has taught me that the saying of "it'll be here tomorrow" does not always apply to software and the internet. While Kiddy Kene is still active, a lot of YouTubers are leaving left and right, and there's a good chance
their discord servers will be shut down with it.

With all of that in mind, this is a backup of Kiddy Kene's Minecraft creations. This is not intended to steal or infringe, but merely to preserve if that ever becomes necessary. 
Because we really wouldn't want months and months of his work to disappear.

# How to install
On Windows, you can type in `%APPDATA%/.minecraft` into File Explorer to get to your Minecraft folder, then your worlds go in `saves` and your resource packs go in `resourcepacks`.
I don't play Minecraft on Mac or Linux but they should be in `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft` and `~/.minecraft` respectively, according to the [Minecraft wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/.minecraft).

For the AI 3D printer, Discord, End Update texture pack, and End Update world: unzip the file, and put the one subfolder in your minecraft resource pack (for the End Update texture pack, resource packs actually work fine as a non-zipped subfolder in there) or world folder

For the Deep Dark texture pack: put `deep darky texture pak.zip` directly in your resource packs folder (it will work zipped)

For the Deep Dark world: It wouldn't fit in this GitHub repo because it was too big, so I had to split it. You need to download 7-Zip, and open `deep dark world donload_2.7z.001`. It should automatically detect the other ones and show you the underlying zip file. Click
the zip file, click extract, select the file location, and there should now be a folder called `deep dark dementia` at the location you chose. Move that folder to your minecraft worlds folder.
